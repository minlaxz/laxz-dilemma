Instructions for Debian
Currently supported architectures include amd64, i386, armel, armhf (for Raspbian).

Note: The steps below should be performed with root access (i.e., switching user to root with su or by prefixing each command with sudo).

    Ensure that apt-transport-https and curl are installed.

        
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https curl
        

    Check which version of Debian you are using on this page at the Debian wiki and verify with /etc/debian_version on your system. Then, add lines like the following to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/i2p.list.

    For Stretch (stable):

        deb https://deb.i2p2.de/ stretch main
        deb-src https://deb.i2p2.de/ stretch main


    For Jessie (old-stable):

        deb https://deb.i2p2.de/ jessie main
        deb-src https://deb.i2p2.de/ jessie main


    For Wheezy (obsolete):

        deb https://deb.i2p2.de/ wheezy main
        deb-src https://deb.i2p2.de/ wheezy main


    Note: If you are running Debian Sid (testing), then you can install I2P directly from Debian's main repository:

      sudo apt-get install i2p
      

    Download the key used to sign the repository:


      curl -o i2p-debian-repo.key.asc https://geti2p.net/_static/i2p-debian-repo.key.asc


    Check the fingerprint and owner of the key without importing anything:

        
      gpg -n --import --import-options import-show i2p-debian-repo.key.asc
        

    Add the key to APT's keyring:

        
      sudo apt-key add i2p-debian-repo.key.asc
        

    Notify your package manager of the new repository by entering

        
      sudo apt-get update
        

    This command will retrieve the latest list of software from every repository enabled on your system, including the I2P repository added in step 1.

    You are now ready to install I2P! Installing the i2p-keyring package will ensure that you receive updates to the repository's GPG key.

        
      sudo apt-get install i2p i2p-keyring
      

After the installation process completes you can move on to the next part of starting I2P and configuring it for your system.
