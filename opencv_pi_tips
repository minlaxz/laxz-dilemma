Install prerequisites on your Raspberry Pi
	sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev libhdf5-serial-dev
	sudo apt-get install libqtwebkit4 libqt4-test

Install pip on your Raspberry Pi
	wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
	sudo python3 get-pip.py

Now you have two options:

    Install OpenCV to your global Python site-packages  on your Raspberry Pi
    Install OpenCV into a virtual environment on your Raspberry Pi


Option A: Install OpenCV to your Raspberry Pi system with pip
I wouldn’t recommend this option if you want to be able to use different versions of OpenCV in isolated environments.
But a lot of people deploy their Raspberry Pis for only one purpose/project and don’t need virtual environments.
	sudo pip install opencv-contrib-python


Option B: Install OpenCV into a virtual environment with pip on your Raspberry Pi
Virtual environments are definitely the way to go if your Raspberry Pi has multiple purposes
(or if you’re like me and test code compatibility among various software versions for blog posts all the time ?).
Here’s how to install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper, the tools I use to get it done:
	pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper
Then you need to add the following lines to your ~/.profile .
Open the file using nano , vim , or emacs  and append these lines to the end:
	# virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper
	export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
	export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
	source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
Note: Notice that for the Raspberry Pi, we are editing ~/.profile
…not ~/.bash_profile  (macOS) or ~/.bashrc  (Ubuntu).

	source ~/.profile

Create python 3 virtual enviroment
	mkvirtualenv cv -p python3

Activate
	workon cv


(cv) 	pip install opencv-contrib-python
(cv)	 pip install "picamera[array]"

Testing our pip install of OpenCV

workon cv
pip install imutils
pip install "picamera[array]" # if you're using a Raspberry Pi

Double check!!
