I have ubuntu gnome default display manager installed.

but i wanted to test some KDE sweet themes, so i installed ubuntu-kde-plasma (it is kdesktop)

while installig, ubuntu request me to choose gdm or sddm (simple dm) for KDE, 
as tuto i choosed it (sddm), 


but after some hours, i got bored with kde, so purged it then my display gone!

only cli


so i got no idea and reistall plasma, after that i have run

sudo dpkg-reconfigure sddm

then ubuntu request again sddm or gdm 

according above web, I choosed gdm bcz it is gnome.

fixed.
