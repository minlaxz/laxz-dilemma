My SOLUTION : "Have to download this software --originally developed by Microsoft-- I edited some code of this. 
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WteuqNo_aWflDUFHx5F19JqEH1Nh3Vz1
it does need to be run as administrator of windows.And problem is that I am running Power Shell But CAN'T Get admin privilege
it is stuck and saying --run as admin exiting.
so i delete -exit- code from the text software named "DG_Readiness_Tool_v3.5.ps1" (it is from microsoft)
problem is running power shell as admin but can't get admin privilege
So i need to call Power Shell v2 -right click on power shell and run as admin
or from cmd.exe - command this -----powershell "start-process powershell -verb runas"
DG_Readiness_Tool_v3.5.ps1 -Disable -AutoReboot
