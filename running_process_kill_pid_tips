ps -A | grep firefox
ps -A | less

pstree | grep keybase


pgrep firefox

kill -9 PID

pkill firefox
killall firefox


The renice command changes the nice value of an already running process. The nice value determines what priority the process runs with. A value of -19 is very high priority, while a value of 19 is very low priority. A value of 0 is the default priority.


If you’re making a process run at a higher priority, you’ll require root permissions. 

sudo renice -19 firefox or some


xkill for GUI
