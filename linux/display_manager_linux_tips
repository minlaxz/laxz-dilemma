I have ubuntu gnome default display manager installed.

but i wanted to test some KDE sweet themes, so i installed ubuntu-kde-plasma (it is kdesktop)

while installig, ubuntu request me to choose gdm or sddm (simple dm) for KDE, 
as tuto i choosed it (sddm), 


but after some hours, i got bored with kde, so purged it then my display gone!

only cli


so i got no idea and reistall plasma, after that i have run

sudo dpkg-reconfigure sddm

then ubuntu request again sddm or gdm 

according above web, I choosed gdm bcz it is gnome.

fixed.







------------------


Install your previous desktop environment (it should be in cache so you dont need to download anything)

sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop
You will still see kubuntu on boot screen. So to remove that

sudo update-initramfs -u
Reboot.
On login screen, choose desktop session other than KDE

And finally remove all traces of kde

sudo apt remove --purge kubuntu-desktop
sudo apt autoremove
If you still see kde login screen (rarely)

sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm3
sudo apt remove --purge sddm
Replace gdm3 with your current desktop environment's display manager. Common on ubuntu are gdm, lightdm
