list
	fsidk -l
maybe sab1 sdb2 ... it is sdb

file system check
	file -s /dev/sdb1 or 2 whatever


create mount point
	mkdir /mnt/external

A mount point is simply a directory where the files from your drive will be linked so that you can locate them.
The directory name, "external" in the example, can be any name that you would like,
just avoid using spaces and remember that the name is case-sensitive.

mout
	mount -t vfat /dev/sdb /mnt/external
Replace "sdb" and "external" with the appropriate device and directory.
Replace "vfat" (used for FAT32 file systems) with "ntfs-3g" for NTFS file systems or "ext4" for EXT4 file systems.
To unmount the drive when you are finished, type "umount /dev/sdb" and press "Enter."
